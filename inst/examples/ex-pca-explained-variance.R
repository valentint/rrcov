##  Showing correctly the percentage explained variance in PCA
##
##  If not all PCA were extracted, which is a great advantage in
##  the case in high dimensional data, the PCA methods in rrcov
##  could not show correctly the percentage of variance explained,
##  Because the total variance explained, i.e. the sum of _all_
##  eigenvalues was not known. Now this is fixed, differently in
##  the different methods.

##  In PcaClassic, PcaCov and PcaLocantore, this is nt a problem
##  because always all eigenvalues are computed.
##
##  In PcaHubert there is a preliminary step in which the classical
##  PCA are computed on the data set without outliers identified by
##  the Stahel-Donoho Outlyingness. All eigenvalues are calculated
##  and used for selecting the number of components and for
##  presenting the percentage of explaned variance.
##
##  In the pure projection purcuit methods PcaGrid() and PcaProj()
##  this cannot be done and a note is written that the proportion
##  of variance and cumulative proportion are not shown because the
##  chosen number of components is smaller than the rank of the data
##  matrix.
